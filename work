Allocator Domains
All allocating functions belong to one of three different “domains”.
These domains represent different allocation strategies and are optimized for different purposes. 
The specific details on how every domain allocates memory or what internal functions each domain calls is considered
an implementation detail, but for debugging purposes a simplified table can be found at here.
There is no hard requirement to use the memory returned by the allocation functions belonging to a given domain for only the purposes hinted by
that domain (although this is the recommended practice).
 For example, one could use the memory returned by PyMem_RawMalloc() for allocating Python objects or the memory returned by 
 PyObject_Malloc() for allocating memory for buffers.
pointers in c
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value.
A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same type, and is created with the * operator.
